HOW TO REQUEST DATA Connect to the microservice using ZeroMQ Send a JSON object with a "playerData" key containing a list of numeric arrays Recieve a confirmation message from the microservice

Request format message should look similar to this: { "playerData": [ [playerId, coinsCollected, deathCount, levelNumber] ] }

Each player ID must be unique. If the ID already exists in the save file, the data will be updated.

HOW TO RECIEVE DATA To reviece data, you can find the encrypted code in a save file folder that is made automatically with use of the microservice. You will have to decrypt it.
